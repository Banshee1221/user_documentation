# Requesting Help

During your time at SANBI, you may have technical enquiries. This could be, but not limited to, the creating of virtual machines, issues with running your jobs on the cluster or problems with your SANBI supplied laptop.

If you feel that you have an issue that you would like the technical staff to have a look at, feel free to send a mail to [help@sanbi.ac.za](mailto:help@sanbi.ac.za) with a **_detailed description of the issue_** from your UWC or SANBI email account.

You can also feel free to use the SANBI Slack channel, but you will be asked to create a ticket by sending the email as mentioned regardless.

You can track the progress of open tickets by going to the [SANBI Helpdesk Website](https://sanbi.ngdesk.com/)
